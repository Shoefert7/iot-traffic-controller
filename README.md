ðŸ’» Code Examples & Logic

While specific project files may not be available, the core logic and programming concepts applied in this project are outlined below, demonstrating proficiency in embedded systems development.
Basic Traffic Light Sequence Logic (Module 3/4)

    Setup: Initialize GPIO pins for multiple Red, Yellow, and Green LEDs as outputs.

    Loop: Implement a continuous loop that cycles through traffic light states (e.g., Green for 2 seconds, Yellow for 1 second, Red for 3 seconds) by setting appropriate digitalWrite commands for each LED.

Crosswalk Button Logic (Module 5)

    Input: Digital read from a push button configured as INPUT_PULLUP.

    Logic: When the crosswalk button is pressed, the traffic light sequence transitions to a "Stop All Traffic" state (both directions red), activates a "Walk" countdown on the Serial Monitor, and then returns to normal operation.

    Output: LED state changes, Serial Monitor output for countdown.

LCD Display & Emergency Buzzer Logic (Module 6)

    Setup: Initialize the LCD display via I2C. Initialize buzzer GPIO as output.

    Logic:

        Display status messages on the LCD (e.g., "Do Not Walk", "Walk").

        Activate the buzzer for emergency alerts or specific sequence changes.

    Output: Text on LCD, audible alerts.

PIR Motion Sensor Integration (Final Component)

    Input: Digital read from a PIR motion sensor.

    Logic: When motion is detected by the PIR sensor, an emergency light (e.g., a blue LED) is activated, and potentially an emergency buzzer, overriding normal traffic light operations.

    Output: Emergency light activation, potential buzzer alert, Serial Monitor messages (e.g., "motion detected", "Emergency button was pressed").
